# Wilson Family Game Database
Hi all! This is a personal project I worked on for my sister and her family, who love playing games together as a family. My brother-in-law has a type-written list of games to share with family and guests to help decide on a game to play, however a static list wasn't sustainable since they're adding new games on a regular basis.

I converted their written list to a Google Sheets document that they can edit as needed and then became the database this site runs on. I used [Papa Parse](https://papaparse.com) for the Google Sheets to CSV conversion and looped through the game array to filter search results.

For the CSS, I used a varation of the [Holy Grail flexbox layout](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/holy-grail/). I also used [SUNY Brockport's official school colors](https://www.brockport.edu/support/web_team/style_guide/colors.html) and comparable fonts since my sister and her husband are both alumni.
